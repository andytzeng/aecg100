Getting started
===============
To access the device, you need to add yourself to the dialout group.
  $ cat /dev/ttyACM4
  cat: /dev/ttyACM4: Permission denied

  $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>

Compilation environment
=======================
Linux version 3.10.0-693.5.2.el7.x86_64 
gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623
Tested in Python 3.6.8

File list
=========
SDK/libaecgx86.so     - 32-bit shared library
SDK/libaecgx64.so     - 64-bit shared library
SDK/AECG100.h         - SDK library interfaces

Issues
======
1. After you plug the AECG device in, ModemManager may open the serial port and
then you can not normally use the device. 
  $ stty -F /dev/ttmACM0 -a
  stty: /dev/ttyACM0: Device or resource busy

Itâ€™s easy to fix with a udev rule. You need to write a new udev rule to skip 
the WhaleTeq devices. Create the file /etc/udev/rules.d/usb-whaleteq.rules and 
enter the following content, all on a single line:

ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="000a", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"

Reload the udev rules with the following command:
  $sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
