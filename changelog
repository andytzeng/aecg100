WhaleTeq AECG100 SDK
====================

IMPORTANT:
1. if the R PPG module is connected, the Switch sampling function will be disabled 

Version: 1.0.1.8  - 2020-12-23
==============================
1. CHG: remove structure PPG_LED_PULSE_SETTING
2. CHG: remove WTQReadLEDPulseSetting(), WTQWriteLEDPulseSetting(); which are replaced with ReadLEDPulseGroupSetting() and WriteLEDPulseGroupSetting()
3. FIX: when play raw ECG data, if the respiration is enabled, the ampltude of the output signal is incorrect
4. CHG: when the device is connected, reset the output lead to RA
5. CHG: when the device is connected, reset the input impedance to off
6. CHG: when the device is connected, reset the respiration to off
7. NEW: add Raspberry Pi 64bit library

IMPORTANT:
1. structure PPG_LED_PULSE_SETTING is removed; WTQReadLEDPulseSetting() and WTQWriteLEDPulseSetting() are replaced with ReadLEDPulseGroupSetting() and WriteLEDPulseGroupSetting()

Version: 1.0.1.6  - 2020-09-15
==============================
1. FIX: WTQConnect immediately returns with false result
2. FIX: blocking thread not killed when dll is unloaded

Version: 1.0.1.4  - 2020-09-02
==============================
1. Add library for Raspberry 32bit

Version: 1.0.1.3  - 2020-08-20
==============================
1. support new PPG module (only R LED); if the new R PPG module is connected, the Switch sampling function will be disabled
2. ECG noise: support 100Hz/ 120Hz
3. PPG noise: 100Hz/ 120Hz/ White Noise
4. fix continuous WTQOutputECG calls results in no waveform generated
5. fix OutputSignalCallback function prototype is incorrect 
6. After the waveform outputting is stopped, there are unexpected short signals are generated
7. fix the play raw delay issue
8. remove ECG respiration Basic Level 500 ohm
9. fix: the zero voltage of ECG variable DC is not precisely configured

Version: 1.0.0.1  - 2020-02-15
==============================
1. initial version
